<section id="welcome">
  <h2 class="section-title">Welcome</h2>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by — I’m glad you’re here.</p>
  <p>I'm Viktor Petermann — a technologist by training, a strategist by passion, and someone who's spent nearly three decades navigating the intersection of business, IT, and regulatory transformation. My journey has taken me from programming and disaster recovery all the way to enterprise leadership and board-level strategy in financial institutions.</p>
  <p>What ties it all together is a deep belief in structure <em>and</em> purpose. Technology is only meaningful when it solves the right problem — reliably, securely, and with the customer in mind. I’ve spent my career building frameworks, teams, and systems that make that possible.</p>
  <p>This site is not just a collection of facts or roles — it’s an invitation to explore how I think, how I lead, and how I approach complexity with clarity. Whether you’re exploring transformation, navigating change, or just curious — I hope something here resonates.</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <blockquote>“The world, to me, is both structure and wonder.”</blockquote>
  <p>I was born and raised in Estonia — in a world that was changing fast. As systems collapsed and new ones emerged, I became fascinated not just by technology, but by how systems are designed, maintained, and rebuilt.</p>
  <p>My first defining task was building a full disaster recovery and business continuity setup for a regional bank. No blueprint. No legacy system. Just problems that had to be solved. That experience taught me that <em>resilience is built, not assumed</em> — and that the best solutions require people, process, and technology working in sync.</p>
  <p>Over time, my work unfolded in distinct phases — each expanding my view of how technology supports meaningful change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technology roots</strong> — from programming and infrastructure to service continuity.</li>
    <li><strong>IT governance</strong> — building resilient service delivery models based on ITIL, COBIT, and CMMI.</li>
    <li><strong>Business leadership</strong> — shaping customer value propositions and strategies for digital payments, omnichannel banking, and compliance with regulations like PSD2 and DORA.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture and integration</strong> — managing distributed ecosystems of teams, tools, and services across cloud, DevOps, and AI-driven environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In every phase, one lesson stayed constant: <em>Technology is the “how” — but purpose defines the “what” and “why.”</em></p>
  <p>Good architecture creates freedom. Regulation, when understood and applied with intent, protects rather than restricts. Maturity enables agility. And leadership? It’s not about having all the answers — it's about enabling better questions, and making sure people feel safe to ask them.</p>

<section id="principles">
  <h2 class="section-title">Principles</h2>

  <h3>Centralize to Establish, Distribute to Optimize</h3>
  <p>Sustainable systems need both structure and flow. In every transformation I’ve led, the pattern is clear: start by establishing clarity through central rules, and then distribute ownership to scale and adapt. Whether in IT governance, organizational design, or the history of empires, decentralization without a coherent foundation leads to drift. Alignment first — autonomy after.</p>

  <h3>Simplicity is the Deepest Intelligence</h3>
  <p>Complexity impresses. Simplicity endures. I’ve learned that grasping a few core principles is far more powerful than memorizing endless details. This drives my passion for systems thinking — using mind maps, mental models, and frameworks to organize knowledge and enable clear decisions.</p>
  <blockquote>“Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction.”<br>– <em>Albert Einstein</em></blockquote>

  <h3>We Are Not Binary</h3>
  <p>Humans are not deterministic. Machines are. I am deeply interested in the limits of artificial intelligence — in its struggle to replicate the “maybe” that defines us. Human thought is shaped not just by inputs, but by context, emotion, intuition, and history. Ambiguity isn’t a flaw — it’s what makes us adaptable, creative, and ethical.</p>
  <p>Since the mid-2020s, several large language models such as ChatGPT have passed modern, rigorous variants of the Turing test. But are machines now really able to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human? That “maybe” part — the space between simple yes and no, combined with intention and feeling — is something far harder to reproduce.</p>
