<section id="welcome">
  <h2 class="section-title">Welcome</h2>
  <p>I'm Viktor Petermann — a strategic IT executive and transformation leader with 20+ years of experience delivering large-scale digital and business transformations within financial institutions.</p>
  <p>My background includes systems engineering, financial services, and enterprise resilience. My work lies at the intersection of structure and strategy, technology and human judgment. I specialize in integration — bridging business and IT, and delivering compliant, resilient, and customer-centric solutions in regulated environments.</p>
  <p>I’m known for a systematic approach to building high-performance teams, governance frameworks, and transformation programs across multiple geographies — with a leadership style that adapts to specific demands and team dynamics.</p>
  <p>Whether you're here to explore my beliefs, learn about my experience, or connect for potential collaboration — I'm glad you're here.</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <blockquote>“The world, to me, is both structure and wonder.”</blockquote>
  <p>I was born and raised in Estonia, shaped by a time of transformation — when political systems, economies, and industries were being redefined.</p>
  <p>My early career began in the heart of this change, where I faced a foundational challenge: designing and implementing a cross-border Business Continuity and IT Disaster Recovery framework for a regional bank from zero. It was a defining moment — not theoretical, but practical.</p>
  <p>That experience taught me something essential: lasting outcomes require a systematic approach — one that connects people, processes, and technology into a unified delivery model. This led me to focus on establishing strong governance and embedding IT Service Management and process-based frameworks (ITIL, CMMI) across organizations.</p>
  <p>Over time, my perspective expanded. I moved from a purely technology-driven mindset to a business-focused one — because technology is only as valuable as the problems it solves. Without a deep understanding of customer needs, even the most elegant technical solution can fall short. Technology is the “how,” but the “what” and “why” come from people.</p>
  <p>My academic foundation is in IT systems engineering, where I learned that success starts not with configuration, but with clarity of purpose. If you can define the outcome from the customer's perspective (which is the creative part), then everything else — architecture, design, even automation — becomes a matter of structured and systematic translation.</p>
  <p>Increasingly, this translation is handled by AI and automated frameworks. But what remains uniquely human is the ability to ask: “Is this what we needed?” and “Does it deliver the value we intended?”</p>
  <p>Since then, I’ve led transformations across the Baltics and Nordics — in banking, infrastructure, operations, and strategy. My career has been defined by balancing structure with flexibility, vision with execution, and systems thinking with human insight.</p>
  <p>I believe in frameworks — and I believe in the unexpected. I believe in disciplined architecture — and in the intuition that sometimes rewrites it. I believe in the power of systems to drive change — and in the necessity of asking what change is worth driving.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Principles</h2>

  <h3>Centralize to Establish, Distribute to Optimize</h3>
  <p>Sustainable systems need both structure and flow. In every transformation I’ve led, the pattern is clear: start by establishing clarity through central rules, and then distribute ownership to scale and adapt. Whether in IT governance, organizational design, or the history of empires, decentralization without a coherent foundation leads to drift. Alignment first — autonomy after.</p>

  <h3>Simplicity is the Deepest Intelligence</h3>
  <p>Complexity impresses. Simplicity endures. I’ve learned that grasping a few core principles is far more powerful than memorizing endless details. This drives my passion for systems thinking — using mind maps, mental models, and frameworks to organize knowledge and enable clear decisions.</p>
  <blockquote>“Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction.”<br>– <em>Albert Einstein</em></blockquote>

  <h3>We Are Not Binary</h3>
  <p>Humans are not deterministic. Machines are. I am deeply interested in the limits of artificial intelligence — in its struggle to replicate the “maybe” that defines us. Human thought is shaped not just by inputs, but by context, emotion, intuition, and history. Ambiguity isn’t a flaw — it’s what makes us adaptable, creative, and ethical.</p>
  <p>Since the mid-2020s, several large language models such as ChatGPT have passed modern, rigorous variants of the Turing test. But are machines now really able to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human? That “maybe” part — the space between simple yes and no, combined with intention and feeling — is something far harder to reproduce.</p>
